This app is supposed to be like "Tinder" but for finding rescue animals

You will create a profile
Add a photo
Answer questions
-search radius
-what kind of animal
-what type of housing you have
-yard space
-any other animals you have
-age you prefer
-if you have kids - how old they are
-breed
-etc...

Once you have answered questions- this becomes your "search" and you are
matched with corresponding animals that match those requirements

You should be able to swipe on them
-left means pass
-right means favorite and save

Once you find an animal you want
-fill out an application
-send that application to that rescue

If you click "find a match" -
it directs you to a sign up page which will ask for
-name
-email
-password
then this will direct to questions that make up profile

if you click "sign in" -
it directs you to page for input
-email
-password
then this will direct you to profile

once in profile -
-there will be a button to start "swiping"
-a button for favorites

- and a button for any responses from applications
